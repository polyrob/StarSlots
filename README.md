Java-based slot machine game using TMDB actor/film information for matching.

Instead of matching on cherries and lemons and nonsense, these reels pull actors and actress from various modern films and then cross-references their filmographies to see if they've appeared in any films together.

Still very much a WIP.

This game uses the libgdx framework and is written in Java. Blog post about development of this guy can be found [here](https://robbomb.wordpress.com/2017/02/09/making-a-filmography-slot-machine-game/).
